# Project: Forecasting Electricity Consumption
_Forecasting Electricity Consumption_ is a low-scale small project that aims at forecasting electricity consumption for buildings
using univariate exponential smoothing, NNAR (neural network auto-regressive), and ARIMA models. Will also consider multivariate
dynamic regression, NNAR, and VAR models.

Model selection is mainly based on cross-validation technique; and model performance is measured using mean square error.
